# About this project
This project is a course assignment of Software Engineering and Computing III and it is intended to build a web application about crowd-sourcing for annotation.<br>
The background is like this: there are a group of people trying to build their unique machine learning model. In order to do that, they need annotated data to train their model. Assuming the data they need could not be found from the Internet, they have to find a way to get their own data. However, creating such large quantity of annotated data is obviously not realistic for a small team to complete in a short time and here comes the crowd-sourcing annotation system.
Considering there are three types of roles here. First of all, system managers, who mainly just ensure the system is running normally. The second and third roles are task publishers, people who need human resources to help annotate pictures or data and workers, people who want to make some money by annotating the raw data provided by publishers.

Our team of four is targeting to build a website to achieve this goal or reach the requirement as much as possible.
